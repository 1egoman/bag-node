      <h1>Bag: grocery shopping of the future</h1>
      <p>
        Hey, you've stumbled across Bag, a side project by Ryan Gaus. I'm
        trying to make grocery shopping dare I say, fun. Well, at least not
        something that you hate every week.
      </p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        Each user has a central "bag" that food items can be put into. Users can
        search for recipes created within the app and put those in their bag for
        centralized access. Bag will do all the magic of pulling in the price for
        each item and recipe, and with a few taps, will convert your bag's contents
        into a grocery list, sorted to match your grocery store's layout. To
        automate recipe discovery further, Bag will recommend recipes it thinks
        you'd like and give you a chance to decrease grocery-planning further.
        ("My Picks")

        each item yet.)</small>

      <h2>Whoa! I want to try that! Where can I get the app?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm glad you like it! Though its almost feature-complete, Bag is still quite
        buggy. I haven't gotten around to compiling it for iOS but I have for
        android. <a href="/builds/Bag-0.4.0.apk">Here's the latest android
          build</a>. If you think you can help me build it for ios then
        <a

        >shoot me an email</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is the man behind all of this nonsense?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a student in Central New York that occasionally has some free time,
        and too many projects. This is one of them. <a href="//rgaus.net">Check
          out my website</a>.
